When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Remote repository is useful while working in a team and working on open-source projects.
    I personally see remote repo as a backup too, because if your computer burns down, you
    can get a new one and clone repo to resume working! :) So in my opinion, one should make
    it a habit to commit every logical change to local repo and push it straight away to remote
    repo.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    The most important reason is to be able to choose which local branch you want
    to pull changes to. It is possible that on remote repo there is only 'master'
    branch, but locally you are working on an experimental branch, where you need
    new changes. Also sometimes you just want to create another branch and pull
    changes to just see if all is good and then proceed further by merging.
