What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  When you init a repository, git creates a hidden '.git' folder in the directory.
  One needs to add the untracked files using 'git add'.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
  Working directory cannot store different versions of the changed files, whereas
  staging area can. Staging area help gather multiple files which may be part of
  single logical change. Hence, putting files in staging area tracks the changes
  and separates them from the files which don't need to be tracked in the working
  directory.

change?
